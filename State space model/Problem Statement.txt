i. Model an electrical system for determining charge ‘q’ and the circuit consists of the
components involving inductor, resistor and capacitor with some input voltage.
where,
The input voltage = (10+Avg (USN’s (D 2 D 3 ))) sin200t,
Inductance in henry=median (USN’s(D 2 D 3 ) of all students in a group,
Resistance in ohm =mode (YY) of all students in a group and
Capacitance in F =ceil (avg (DD)) of all students in a group
ii. Find the state space model and solve the differential equation.
iii. Verify your answer by solving the same problem in MATLAB using inbuilt code.

Avg D2D3 = 22
Median D2D3 = 25
MODE YY = 03
Avg DD = 17.6667 =18

input voltage = (10+22) sin200t 
inductance in henry = 25
Resistance in ohm = 03
Capacitance in F = ceil(18)
